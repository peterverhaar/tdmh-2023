      "your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\r\n",
      "adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. why,\r\n",
      "my dear basil, he is a narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\r\n",
      "intellectual expression and all that. but beauty, real beauty, ends\r\n",
      "where an intellectual expression begins. intellect is in itself a mode\r\n",
      "of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. the moment one\r\n",
      "sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\r\n",
      "horrid. look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\r\n",
      "how perfectly hideous they are! except, of course, in the church. but\r\n",
      "then in the church they don’t think. a bishop keeps on saying at the\r\n",
      "age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\r\n",
      "and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\r\n",
      "your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\r\n",
      "whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. i feel quite sure of\r\n",
      "that. he is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\r\n",
      "in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\r\n",

      "look like him. you shrug your shoulders? i am telling you the truth.\r\n",
      "there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\r\n",
      "the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\r\n",
      "steps of kings. it is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\r\n",
      "the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. they can sit\r\n",
      "at their ease and gape at the play. if they know nothing of victory,\r\n",
      "they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. they live as we all\r\n",

      "neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\r\n",
      "your rank and wealth, harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\r\n",
      "whatever it may be worth; dorian gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\r\n",
      "for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\r\n",

      "“dorian gray? is that his name?” asked lord henry, walking across the\r\n",

      "“yes, that is his name. i didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“but why not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“oh, i can’t explain. when i like people immensely, i never tell their\r\n",
      "names to any one. it is like surrendering a part of them. i have grown\r\n",
      "to love secrecy. it seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\r\n",
      "mysterious or marvellous to us. the commonest thing is delightful if\r\n",
      "one only hides it. when i leave town now i never tell my people where i\r\n",
      "am going. if i did, i would lose all my pleasure. it is a silly habit,\r\n",
      "i dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\r\n",
      "one’s life. i suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“not at all,” answered lord henry, “not at all, my dear basil. you seem\r\n",
      "to forget that i am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\r\n",
      "makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. i\r\n",
      "never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what i am doing.\r\n",
      "when we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\r\n",
      "down to the duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\r\n",
      "most serious faces. my wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\r\n",
      "than i am. she never gets confused over her dates, and i always do. but\r\n",
      "when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. i sometimes wish\r\n",
      "she would; but she merely laughs at me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i hate the way you talk about your married life, harry,” said basil\r\n",
      "hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “i\r\n",
      "believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\r\n",
      "thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. you are an extraordinary\r\n",
      "fellow. you never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\r\n",
      "your cynicism is simply a pose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose i know,”\r\n",
      "cried lord henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\r\n",
      "garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\r\n",
      "stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. the sunlight slipped over the\r\n",
      "polished leaves. in the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "after a pause, lord henry pulled out his watch. “i am afraid i must be\r\n",
      "going, basil,” he murmured, “and before i go, i insist on your\r\n",
      "answering a question i put to you some time ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“what is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“you know quite well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i do not, harry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“well, i will tell you what it is. i want you to explain to me why you\r\n",
      "won’t exhibit dorian gray’s picture. i want the real reason.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i told you the real reason.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“no, you did not. you said it was because there was too much of\r\n",
      "yourself in it. now, that is childish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“harry,” said basil hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\r\n",
      "portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\r\n",
      "of the sitter. the sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. it is\r\n",
      "not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\r\n",
      "the coloured canvas, reveals himself. the reason i will not exhibit\r\n",
      "this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of\r\n",
      "my own soul.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "lord henry laughed. “and what is that?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i will tell you,” said hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\r\n",
      "over his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i am all expectation, basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“oh, there is really very little to tell, harry,” answered the painter;\r\n",
      "“and i am afraid you will hardly understand it. perhaps you will hardly\r\n",
      "believe it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "lord henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\r\n",
      "the grass and examined it. “i am quite sure i shall understand it,” he\r\n",
      "replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\r\n",
      "“and as for believing things, i can believe anything, provided that it\r\n",
      "is quite incredible.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\r\n",
      "lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\r\n",
      "languid air. a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\r\n",
      "blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\r\n",
      "wings. lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallward’s heart\r\n",
      "beating, and wondered what was coming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“the story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “two\r\n",
      "months ago i went to a crush at lady brandon’s. you know we poor\r\n",
      "artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\r\n",
      "remind the public that we are not savages. with an evening coat and a\r\n",
      "white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\r\n",
      "a reputation for being civilized. well, after i had been in the room\r\n",
      "about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\r\n",
      "academicians, i suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\r\n",
      "me. i turned half-way round and saw dorian gray for the first time.\r\n",
      "when our eyes met, i felt that i was growing pale. a curious sensation\r\n",
      "of terror came over me. i knew that i had come face to face with some\r\n",
      "one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if i allowed it to\r\n",
      "do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\r\n",
      "itself. i did not want any external influence in my life. you know\r\n",
      "yourself, harry, how independent i am by nature. i have always been my\r\n",
      "own master; had at least always been so, till i met dorian gray.\r\n",
      "then—but i don’t know how to explain it to you. something seemed to\r\n",
      "tell me that i was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. i had\r\n",
      "a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\r\n",
      "exquisite sorrows. i grew afraid and turned to quit the room. it was\r\n",
      "not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. i take\r\n",
      "no credit to myself for trying to escape.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“conscience and cowardice are really the same things, basil. conscience\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“i don’t believe that, harry, and i don’t believe you do either.\r\n",
      "however, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for i used\r\n",
      "to be very proud—i certainly struggled to the door. there, of course, i\r\n",
      "stumbled against lady brandon. ‘you are not going to run away so soon,\r\n",
      "mr. hallward?’ she screamed out. you know her curiously shrill voice?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said lord henry,\r\n",
      "pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i could not get rid of her. she brought me up to royalties, and people\r\n",
      "with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\r\n",
      "parrot noses. she spoke of me as her dearest friend. i had only met her\r\n",
      "once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. i believe\r\n",
      "some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\r\n",
      "been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\r\n",
      "nineteenth-century standard of immortality. suddenly i found myself\r\n",
      "face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\r\n",
      "stirred me. we were quite close, almost touching. our eyes met again.\r\n",
      "it was reckless of me, but i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him.\r\n",
      "perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. it was simply inevitable. we\r\n",
      "would have spoken to each other without any introduction. i am sure of\r\n",
      "that. dorian told me so afterwards. he, too, felt that we were destined\r\n",

      "him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\r\n",

      "were! how clear, and vivid, and cruel! one could not escape from them.\r\n",
      "and yet what a subtle magic there was in them! they seemed to be able\r\n",
      "to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\r\n",

      "so real as words?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\r\n",

      "with his subtle smile, lord henry watched him. he knew the precise\r\n",
      "psychological moment when to say nothing. he felt intensely interested.\r\n",
      "he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\r\n",
      "and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\r\n",
      "which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\r\n",
      "wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience.\r\n",
      "he had merely shot an arrow into the air. had it hit the mark? how\r\n",
      "fascinating the lad was!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\r\n",

      "only from strength. he was unconscious of the silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“my dear fellow, i am so sorry. when i am painting, i can’t think of\r\n",
      "anything else. but you never sat better. you were perfectly still. and\r\n",
      "i have caught the effect i wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright\r\n",
      "look in the eyes. i don’t know what harry has been saying to you, but\r\n",
      "he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. i suppose\r\n",
      "he has been paying you compliments. you mustn’t believe a word that he\r\n",
      "says.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "reason that i don’t believe anything he has told me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“you know you believe it all,” said lord henry, looking at him with his\r\n",
      "dreamy languorous eyes. “i will go out to the garden with you. it is\r\n",
      "horribly hot in the studio. basil, let us have something iced to drink,\r\n",
      "something with strawberries in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“certainly, harry. just touch the bell, and when parker comes i will\r\n",

      "will join you later on. don’t keep dorian too long. i have never been\r\n",
      "in better form for painting than i am to-day. this is going to be my\r\n",
      "masterpiece. it is my masterpiece as it stands.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "lord henry went out to the garden and found dorian gray burying his\r\n",
      "face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\r\n",
      "perfume as if it had been wine. he came close to him and put his hand\r\n",
      "upon his shoulder. “you are quite right to do that,” he murmured.\r\n",
      "“nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\r\n",
      "senses but the soul.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the lad started and drew back. he was bareheaded, and the leaves had\r\n",
      "tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. there\r\n",
      "was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\r\n",
      "suddenly awakened. his finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\r\n",
      "hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“yes,” continued lord henry, “that is one of the great secrets of\r\n",
      "life—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\r\n",
      "of the soul. you are a wonderful creation. you know more than you think\r\n",
      "you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "dorian gray frowned and turned his head away. he could not help liking\r\n",
      "the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. his romantic,\r\n",
      "olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. there was\r\n",
      "something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. his\r\n",
      "cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. they moved,\r\n",
      "as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\r\n",
      "but he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. why had it been\r\n",
      "left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? he had known basil\r\n",
      "hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\r\n",
      "him. suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\r\n",
      "have disclosed to him life’s mystery. and, yet, what was there to be\r\n",
      "afraid of? he was not a schoolboy or a girl. it was absurd to be\r\n",
      "frightened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“let us go and sit in the shade,” said lord henry. “parker has brought\r\n",
      "out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\r\n",
      "quite spoiled, and basil will never paint you again. you really must\r\n",
      "not allow yourself to become sunburnt. it would be unbecoming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“what can it matter?” cried dorian gray, laughing, as he sat down on\r\n",
      "the seat at the end of the garden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“it should matter everything to you, mr. gray.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\r\n",
      "worth having.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i don’t feel that, lord henry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“no, you don’t feel it now. some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\r\n",
      "ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\r\n",
      "branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\r\n",
      "feel it terribly. now, wherever you go, you charm the world. will it\r\n",
      "always be so? ... you have a wonderfully beautiful face, mr. gray.\r\n",
      "don’t frown. you have. and beauty is a form of genius—is higher,\r\n",
      "indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. it is of the great\r\n",
      "facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\r\n",
      "dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. it cannot be\r\n",
      "questioned. it has its divine right of sovereignty. it makes princes of\r\n",
      "those who have it. you smile? ah! when you have lost it you won’t\r\n",
      "smile.... people say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. that\r\n",
      "may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. to me,\r\n",
      "beauty is the wonder of wonders. it is only shallow people who do not\r\n",
      "judge by appearances. the true mystery of the world is the visible, not\r\n",
      "the invisible.... yes, mr. gray, the gods have been good to you. but\r\n",
      "what the gods give they quickly take away. you have only a few years in\r\n",
      "which to live really, perfectly, and fully. when your youth goes, your\r\n",
      "beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\r\n",
      "are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\r\n",
      "mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\r\n",
      "defeats. every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\r\n",
      "dreadful. time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\r\n",
      "roses. you will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. you\r\n",
      "will suffer horribly.... ah! realize your youth while you have it.\r\n",
      "don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\r\n",
      "to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\r\n",
      "ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. these are the sickly aims, the\r\n",
      "false ideals, of our age. live! live the wonderful life that is in you!\r\n",
      "let nothing be lost upon you. be always searching for new sensations.\r\n",
      "be afraid of nothing.... a new hedonism—that is what our century wants.\r\n",
      "you might be its visible symbol. with your personality there is nothing\r\n",
      "you could not do. the world belongs to you for a season.... the moment\r\n",
      "i met you i saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\r\n",
      "of what you really might be. there was so much in you that charmed me\r\n",
      "that i felt i must tell you something about yourself. i thought how\r\n",
      "tragic it would be if you were wasted. for there is such a little time\r\n",
      "that your youth will last—such a little time. the common hill-flowers\r\n",
      "wither, but they blossom again. the laburnum will be as yellow next\r\n",
      "june as it is now. in a month there will be purple stars on the\r\n",
      "clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\r\n",
      "its purple stars. but we never get back our youth. the pulse of joy\r\n",
      "that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. our limbs fail, our senses\r\n",
      "rot. we degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\r\n",
      "passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\r\n",
      "temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. youth! youth!\r\n",
      "there is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "dorian gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. the spray of lilac fell\r\n",
      "from his hand upon the gravel. a furry bee came and buzzed round it for\r\n",
      "a moment. then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\r\n",
      "of the tiny blossoms. he watched it with that strange interest in\r\n",
      "trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\r\n",
      "us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\r\n",
      "cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\r\n",
      "sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. after a time the\r\n",
      "bee flew away. he saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a tyrian\r\n",
      "convolvulus. the flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\r\n",
      "fro.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\r\n",
      "staccato signs for them to come in. they turned to each other and\r\n",
      "smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i am waiting,” he cried. “do come in. the light is quite perfect, and\r\n",
      "you can bring your drinks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "they rose up and sauntered down the walk together. two green-and-white\r\n",
      "butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\r\n",
      "the garden a thrush began to sing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“you are glad you have met me, mr. gray,” said lord henry, looking at\r\n",

      "women are so fond of using it. they spoil every romance by trying to\r\n",
      "make it last for ever. it is a meaningless word, too. the only\r\n",
      "difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\r\n",
      "lasts a little longer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "as they entered the studio, dorian gray put his hand upon lord henry’s\r\n",
      "arm. “in that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\r\n",
      "flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and\r\n",
      "resumed his pose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "lord henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\r\n",
      "the sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\r\n",
      "broke the stillness, except when, now and then, hallward stepped back\r\n",
      "to look at his work from a distance. in the slanting beams that\r\n",
      "streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. the\r\n",
      "heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "after about a quarter of an hour hallward stopped painting, looked for\r\n",
      "a long time at dorian gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\r\n",
      "biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “it is quite\r\n",
      "finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in\r\n",
      "long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "lord henry came over and examined the picture. it was certainly a\r\n",
      "wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“my dear fellow, i congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “it is the\r\n",
      "finest portrait of modern times. mr. gray, come over and look at\r\n",

      "flushed for a moment with pleasure. a look of joy came into his eyes,\r\n",
      "as if he had recognized himself for the first time. he stood there\r\n",
      "motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that hallward was speaking to\r\n",

      "reality of the description flashed across him. yes, there would be a\r\n",
      "day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and\r\n",
      "colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. the scarlet\r\n",

      "wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a bacchante over the\r\n",
      "hills of life, and mocked the slow silenus for being sober. facts fled\r\n",

      "before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure\r\n",

      "more of life. he must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and\r\n",
      "to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. god was very\r\n",

      "hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,\r\n",
      "lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals\r\n",
      "of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. he turned them out and,\r\n",
      "having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library\r\n",
      "towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the\r\n",
      "ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had\r\n",

      "had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.\r\n",
      "finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. in\r\n",
      "the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk\r\n",
      "blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. the expression\r\n",
      "looked different. one would have said that there was a touch of cruelty\r\n",
      "in the mouth. it was certainly strange.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. the\r\n",
      "bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky\r\n",
      "corners, where they lay shuddering. but the strange expression that he\r\n",
      "had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be\r\n",
      "more intensified even. the quivering ardent sunlight showed him the\r\n",
      "lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking\r\n",
      "into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory\r\n",
      "cupids, one of lord henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly\r\n",
      "into its polished depths. no line like that warped his red lips. what\r\n",
      "did it mean?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it\r\n",
      "again. there were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual\r\n",
      "painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had\r\n",
      "altered. it was not a mere fancy of his own. the thing was horribly\r\n",
      "apparent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he threw himself into a chair and began to think. suddenly there\r\n",
      "flashed across his mind what he had said in basil hallward’s studio the\r\n",
      "day the picture had been finished. yes, he remembered it perfectly. he\r\n",
      "had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the\r\n",
      "portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the\r\n",
      "face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that\r\n",
      "the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and\r\n",
      "thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness\r\n",
      "of his then just conscious boyhood. surely his wish had not been\r\n",
      "fulfilled? such things were impossible. it seemed monstrous even to\r\n",
      "think of them. and, yet, there was the picture before him, with the\r\n",
      "touch of cruelty in the mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "cruelty! had he been cruel? it was the girl’s fault, not his. he had\r\n",
      "dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he\r\n",
      "had thought her great. then she had disappointed him. she had been\r\n",
      "shallow and unworthy. and, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over\r\n",
      "him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little\r\n",
      "child. he remembered with what callousness he had watched her. why had\r\n",
      "he been made like that? why had such a soul been given to him? but he\r\n",
      "had suffered also. during the three terrible hours that the play had\r\n",
      "lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. his\r\n",
      "life was well worth hers. she had marred him for a moment, if he had\r\n",
      "wounded her for an age. besides, women were better suited to bear\r\n",
      "sorrow than men. they lived on their emotions. they only thought of\r\n",
      "their emotions. when they took lovers, it was merely to have some one\r\n",
      "with whom they could have scenes. lord henry had told him that, and\r\n",
      "lord henry knew what women were. why should he trouble about sibyl\r\n",
      "vane? she was nothing to him now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "but the picture? what was he to say of that? it held the secret of his\r\n",
      "life, and told his story. it had taught him to love his own beauty.\r\n",
      "would it teach him to loathe his own soul? would he ever look at it\r\n",
      "again?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "no; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. the\r\n",
      "horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. suddenly\r\n",
      "there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men\r\n",
      "mad. the picture had not changed. it was folly to think so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel\r\n",
      "smile. its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. its blue eyes met\r\n",
      "his own. a sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted\r\n",
      "image of himself, came over him. it had altered already, and would\r\n",
      "alter more. its gold would wither into grey. its red and white roses\r\n",
      "would die. for every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and\r\n",
      "wreck its fairness. but he would not sin. the picture, changed or\r\n",
      "unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. he would\r\n",
      "resist temptation. he would not see lord henry any more—would not, at\r\n",
      "any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil\r\n",
      "hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for\r\n",
      "impossible things. he would go back to sibyl vane, make her amends,\r\n",
      "marry her, try to love her again. yes, it was his duty to do so. she\r\n",
      "must have suffered more than he had. poor child! he had been selfish\r\n",
      "and cruel to her. the fascination that she had exercised over him would\r\n",
      "return. they would be happy together. his life with her would be\r\n",
      "beautiful and pure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “how horrible!” he murmured\r\n",
      "to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. when he\r\n",

      "exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an\r\n",
      "extremely interesting question. i fancy that the true explanation is\r\n",
      "this: it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an\r\n",
      "inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their\r\n",
      "absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack\r\n",
      "of style. they affect us just as vulgarity affects us. they give us an\r\n",
      "impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. sometimes,\r\n",
      "however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses\r\n",
      "our lives. if these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply\r\n",
      "appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. suddenly we find that we are\r\n",
      "no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. or rather we are\r\n",
      "both. we watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle\r\n",
      "enthralls us. in the present case, what is it that has really happened?\r\n",
      "some one has killed herself for love of you. i wish that i had ever had\r\n",
      "such an experience. it would have made me in love with love for the\r\n",
      "rest of my life. the people who have adored me—there have not been very\r\n",
      "many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long\r\n",
      "after i had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. they have\r\n",

      "reminiscences. that awful memory of woman! what a fearful thing it is!\r\n",
      "and what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! one should absorb\r\n",

      "digging up the past, and raking up the future. i had buried my romance\r\n",
      "in a bed of asphodel. she dragged it out again and assured me that i\r\n",
      "had spoiled her life. i am bound to state that she ate an enormous\r\n",
      "dinner, so i did not feel any anxiety. but what a lack of taste she\r\n",
      "showed! the one charm of the past is that it is the past. but women\r\n",
      "never know when the curtain has fallen. they always want a sixth act,\r\n",
      "and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose\r\n",
      "to continue it. if they were allowed their own way, every comedy would\r\n",
      "have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.\r\n",
      "they are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. you are\r\n",
      "more fortunate than i am. i assure you, dorian, that not one of the\r\n",

      "told that one is a sinner. conscience makes egotists of us all. yes;\r\n",

      "him, as she died? no; she had died for love of him, and love would\r\n",

      "pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have\r\n",

      "hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had\r\n",

      "pity of it! the pity of it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "for a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that\r\n",
      "existed between him and the picture might cease. it had changed in\r\n",
      "answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain\r\n",
      "unchanged. and yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender\r\n",
      "the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance\r\n",
      "might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?\r\n",
      "besides, was it really under his control? had it indeed been prayer\r\n",
      "that had produced the substitution? might there not be some curious\r\n",
      "scientific reason for it all? if thought could exercise its influence\r\n",
      "upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon\r\n",
      "dead and inorganic things? nay, without thought or conscious desire,\r\n",
      "might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods\r\n",
      "and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?\r\n",
      "but the reason was of no importance. he would never again tempt by a\r\n",

      "alter. that was all. why inquire too closely into it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "for there would be a real pleasure in watching it. he would be able to\r\n",
      "follow his mind into its secret places. this portrait would be to him\r\n",
      "the most magical of mirrors. as it had revealed to him his own body, so\r\n",
      "it would reveal to him his own soul. and when winter came upon it, he\r\n",
      "would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.\r\n",
      "when the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of\r\n",
      "chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. not one\r\n",
      "blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. not one pulse of his life\r\n",
      "would ever weaken. like the gods of the greeks, he would be strong, and\r\n",
      "fleet, and joyous. what did it matter what happened to the coloured\r\n",

      "were in her box. she is perfectly charming; and patti sang divinely.\r\n",
      "don’t talk about horrid subjects. if one doesn’t talk about a thing, it\r\n",

      "of the great romantic tragedies of the age. as a rule, people who act\r\n",
      "lead the most commonplace lives. they are good husbands, or faithful\r\n",
      "wives, or something tedious. you know what i mean—middle-class virtue\r\n",
      "and all that kind of thing. how different sibyl was! she lived her\r\n",
      "finest tragedy. she was always a heroine. the last night she played—the\r\n",
      "night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of\r\n",
      "love. when she knew its unreality, she died, as juliet might have died.\r\n",
      "she passed again into the sphere of art. there is something of the\r\n",
      "martyr about her. her death has all the pathetic uselessness of\r\n",
      "martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. but, as i was saying, you must not\r\n",
      "think i have not suffered. if you had come in yesterday at a particular\r\n",
      "moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would\r\n",
      "have found me in tears. even harry, who was here, who brought me the\r\n",
      "news, in fact, had no idea what i was going through. i suffered\r\n",
      "immensely. then it passed away. i cannot repeat an emotion. no one can,\r\n",

      "story harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty\r\n",
      "years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some\r\n",
      "unjust law altered—i forget exactly what it was. finally he succeeded,\r\n",
      "and nothing could exceed his disappointment. he had absolutely nothing\r\n",
      "to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. and\r\n",
      "besides, my dear old basil, if you really want to console me, teach me\r\n",
      "rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic\r\n",
      "point of view. was it not gautier who used to write about _la\r\n",
      "consolation des arts_? i remember picking up a little vellum-covered\r\n",

      "carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to\r\n",
      "be got from all these. but the artistic temperament that they create,\r\n",
      "or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. to become the spectator of\r\n",
      "one’s own life, as harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. i\r\n",
      "know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. you have not\r\n",
      "realized how i have developed. i was a schoolboy when you knew me. i am\r\n",
      "a man now. i have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. i am\r\n",
      "different, but you must not like me less. i am changed, but you must\r\n",
      "always be my friend. of course, i am very fond of harry. but i know\r\n",

      "that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would\r\n",
      "induce you to send it to any exhibition. you told harry exactly the\r\n",

      "good-looking and that i could paint. even now i cannot help feeling\r\n",
      "that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is\r\n",
      "ever really shown in the work one creates. art is always more abstract\r\n",
      "than we fancy. form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all.\r\n",
      "it often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely\r\n",
      "than it ever reveals him. and so when i got this offer from paris, i\r\n",

      "as a study when he grew somewhat older. it was a large,\r\n",
      "well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last lord\r\n",
      "kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness\r\n",
      "to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and\r\n",

      "painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so\r\n",
      "often hidden himself as a boy. there the satinwood book-case filled\r\n",

      "birds on their gauntleted wrists. how well he remembered it all! every\r\n",

      "not see it. why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? he\r\n",

      "and make them horrible. the hair would lose its brightness, the mouth\r\n",
      "would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old\r\n",

      "back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. perhaps some night he\r\n",
      "might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the\r\n",

      "ear by those grinning lips. the mad passions of a hunted animal stirred\r\n",
      "within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more\r\n",
      "than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. he glanced wildly\r\n",
      "around. something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced\r\n",
      "him. his eye fell on it. he knew what it was. it was a knife that he\r\n",
      "had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had\r\n",
      "forgotten to take away with him. he moved slowly towards it, passing\r\n",
      "hallward as he did so. as soon as he got behind him, he seized it and\r\n",
      "turned round. hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.\r\n",
      "he rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind\r\n",

      "and again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "there was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking\r\n",
      "with blood. three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,\r\n",
      "waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. he stabbed him twice\r\n",
      "more, but the man did not move. something began to trickle on the\r\n",
      "floor. he waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. then he\r\n",
      "threw the knife on the table, and listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. he\r\n",
      "opened the door and went out on the landing. the house was absolutely\r\n",
      "quiet. no one was about. for a few seconds he stood bending over the\r\n",
      "balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.\r\n",
      "then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in\r\n",
      "as he did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with\r\n",
      "bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. had it not been\r\n",
      "for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was\r\n",
      "slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was\r\n",
      "simply asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "how quickly it had all been done! he felt strangely calm, and walking\r\n",
      "over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. the wind\r\n",
      "had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s\r\n",
      "tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. he looked down and saw the\r\n",
      "policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on\r\n",
      "the doors of the silent houses. the crimson spot of a prowling hansom\r\n",
      "gleamed at the corner and then vanished. a woman in a fluttering shawl\r\n",
      "was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. now and\r\n",
      "then she stopped and peered back. once, she began to sing in a hoarse\r\n",
      "voice. the policeman strolled over and said something to her. she\r\n",
      "stumbled away, laughing. a bitter blast swept across the square. the\r\n",
      "gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their\r\n",
      "black iron branches to and fro. he shivered and went back, closing the\r\n",
      "window behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. he did not\r\n",
      "even glance at the murdered man. he felt that the secret of the whole\r\n",
      "thing was not to realize the situation. the friend who had painted the\r\n",
      "fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his\r\n",
      "life. that was enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "then he remembered the lamp. it was a rather curious one of moorish\r\n",
      "workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished\r\n",
      "steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. perhaps it might be missed\r\n",
      "by his servant, and questions would be asked. he hesitated for a\r\n",
      "moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. he could not\r\n",
      "help seeing the dead thing. how still it was! how horribly white the\r\n",
      "long hands looked! it was like a dreadful wax image.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. the\r\n",
      "woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. he stopped\r\n",
      "several times and waited. no: everything was still. it was merely the\r\n",
      "sound of his own footsteps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "when he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.\r\n",
      "they must be hidden away somewhere. he unlocked a secret press that was\r\n",
      "in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,\r\n",
      "and put them into it. he could easily burn them afterwards. then he\r\n",
      "pulled out his watch. it was twenty minutes to two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he sat down and began to think. every year—every month, almost—men were\r\n",
      "strangled in england for what he had done. there had been a madness of\r\n",
      "murder in the air. some red star had come too close to the earth....\r\n",
      "and yet, what evidence was there against him? basil hallward had left\r\n",
      "the house at eleven. no one had seen him come in again. most of the\r\n",
      "servants were at selby royal. his valet had gone to bed.... paris! yes.\r\n",
      "it was to paris that basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he\r\n",
      "had intended. with his curious reserved habits, it would be months\r\n",
      "before any suspicions would be roused. months! everything could be\r\n",
      "destroyed long before then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "a sudden thought struck him. he put on his fur coat and hat and went\r\n",
      "out into the hall. there he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the\r\n",
      "policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the\r\n",
      "bull’s-eye reflected in the window. he waited and held his breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "after a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting\r\n",
      "the door very gently behind him. then he began ringing the bell. in\r\n",

      "door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had\r\n",

      "another log on it. the smell of the singeing clothes and burning\r\n",
      "leather was horrible. it took him three-quarters of an hour to consume\r\n",
      "everything. at the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some\r\n",
      "algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and\r\n",
      "forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "suddenly he started. his eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed\r\n",

      "make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet\r\n",
      "almost loathed. his breath quickened. a mad craving came over him. he\r\n",
      "lit a cigarette and then threw it away. his eyelids drooped till the\r\n",
      "long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. but he still watched the\r\n",
      "cabinet. at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,\r\n",
      "went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. a\r\n",
      "triangular drawer passed slowly out. his fingers moved instinctively\r\n",
      "towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. it was a small chinese\r\n",
      "box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides\r\n",
      "patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round\r\n",
      "crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. he opened it. inside\r\n",
      "was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and\r\n",
      "persistent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "he hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his\r\n",
      "face. then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly\r\n",
      "hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. it was twenty minutes\r\n",

      "a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby\r\n",
      "royal, talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth, who with her husband,\r\n",
      "a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. it was tea-time,\r\n",
      "and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the\r\n",
      "table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at\r\n",
      "which the duchess was presiding. her white hands were moving daintily\r\n",
      "among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that\r\n",
      "dorian had whispered to her. lord henry was lying back in a silk-draped\r\n",
      "wicker chair, looking at them. on a peach-coloured divan sat lady\r\n",
      "narborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last\r\n",
      "brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. three young men\r\n",
      "in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.\r\n",
      "the house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more\r\n",
      "expected to arrive on the next day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“what are you two talking about?” said lord henry, strolling over to\r\n",
      "the table and putting his cup down. “i hope dorian has told you about\r\n",
      "my plan for rechristening everything, gladys. it is a delightful idea.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“but i don’t want to be rechristened, harry,” rejoined the duchess,\r\n",
      "looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “i am quite satisfied with\r\n",
      "my own name, and i am sure mr. gray should be satisfied with his.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“my dear gladys, i would not alter either name for the world. they are\r\n",
      "both perfect. i was thinking chiefly of flowers. yesterday i cut an\r\n",
      "orchid, for my button-hole. it was a marvellous spotted thing, as\r\n",
      "effective as the seven deadly sins. in a thoughtless moment i asked one\r\n",
      "of the gardeners what it was called. he told me it was a fine specimen\r\n",
      "of _robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. it is a sad\r\n",
      "truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.\r\n",
      "names are everything. i never quarrel with actions. my one quarrel is\r\n",
      "with words. that is the reason i hate vulgar realism in literature. the\r\n",
      "man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. it\r\n",
      "is the only thing he is fit for.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“then what should we call you, harry?” she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“his name is prince paradox,” said dorian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i won’t hear of it,” laughed lord henry, sinking into a chair. “from a\r\n",
      "label there is no escape! i refuse the title.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips.\r\n",

      "“i prefer the mistakes of to-day,” she answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“you disarm me, gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“of your shield, harry, not of your spear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“i never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“that is your error, harry, believe me. you value beauty far too much.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "beautiful than to be good. but on the other hand, no one is more ready\r\n",
      "than i am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, gladys. you, as a good\r\n",

      "virtues have made our england what she is.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“like all good reputations, gladys,” interrupted lord henry. “every\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and women rule\r\n",

      "mock sadness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“my dear gladys!” cried lord henry. “how can you say that? romance\r\n",
      "lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.\r\n",
      "besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.\r\n",
      "difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. it merely\r\n",
      "intensifies it. we can have in life but one great experience at best,\r\n",

      "dorian hesitated for a moment. then he threw his head back and laughed.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“often. too often.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "the duchess sighed. “i am searching for peace,” she said, “and if i\r\n",
      "don’t go and dress, i shall have none this evening.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“let me get you some orchids, duchess,” cried dorian, starting to his\r\n",
      "feet and walking down the conservatory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“you are flirting disgracefully with him,” said lord henry to his\r\n",

      "a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. everybody\r\n",
      "started up. the duchess stood motionless in horror. and with fear in\r\n",

      "gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "indifferent to life itself. the consciousness of being hunted, snared,\r\n",
      "tracked down, had begun to dominate him. if the tapestry did but\r\n",
      "tremble in the wind, he shook. the dead leaves that were blown against\r\n",

      "seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. but it\r\n",
      "was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused\r\n",
      "the change. his own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish\r\n",
      "that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. with subtle\r\n",
      "and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. their strong passions\r\n",
      "must either bruise or bend. they either slay the man, or themselves\r\n",
      "die. shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. the loves and sorrows\r\n",
