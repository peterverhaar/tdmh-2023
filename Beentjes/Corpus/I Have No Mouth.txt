 I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream by Harlan EllisonLimp, the body of Gorrister hung from the pink palette; unsupported—hanginghigh above us in the computer chamber; and it did not shiver in the chill, oily breezethat blew eternally through the main cavern. The body hung head down, attached tothe underside of the palette by the sole of its right foot. It had been drained of bloodthrough a precise incision made from ear to ear under the lantern jaw. There was noblood on the reflective surface of the metal floor.When Gorrister joined our group and looked up at himself, it was already toolate for us to realize that, once again, AM had duped us, had had its fun; it had been adiversion on the part of the machine. Three of us had vomited, turning away fromone another in a reflex as ancient as the nausea that had produced it.Gorrister went white. It was almost as though he had seen a voodoo icon, andwas afraid of the future. "Oh, God," he mumbled, and walked away. The three of usfollowed him after a time, and found him sitting with his back to one of the smallerchittering banks, his head in his hands. Ellen knelt down beside him and stroked hishair. He didn't move, but his voice came out of his covered face quite clearly. "Whydoesn't it just do us in and get it over with? Christ, I don't know how much longer Ican go on like this."It was our one hundred and ninth year in the computer.He was speaking for all of us.Nimdok (which was the name the machine had forced him to use, because AMamused itself with strange sounds) was hallucinating that there were canned goodsin the ice caverns. Gorrister and I were very dubious. "It's another shuck," I toldthem. "Like the goddam frozen elephant AM sold us. Benny almost went out of hismind over that one. We'll hike all that way and it'll be putrified or some damn thing.I say forget it. Stay here, it'll have to come up with something pretty soon or we'lldie."Benny shrugged. Three days it had been since we'd last eaten. Worms. Thick, ropey.Nimdok was no more certain. He knew there was the chance, but he was gettingthin. It couldn't be any worse there, than here. Colder, but that didn't matter much.Hot, cold, hail, lava, boils or locusts—it never mattered: the machine masturbatedand we had to take it or die.Ellen decided us. "I've got to have something, Ted. Maybe there'll be someBartlett pears or peaches. Please, Ted, let's try it."I gave in easily. What the hell. Mattered not at all. Ellen was grateful, though.She took me twice out of turn. Even that had ceased to matter. And she never came,so why bother? But the machine giggled every time we did it. Loud, up there, backthere, all around us, he snickered. It snickered. Most of the time I thought of AM asit, without a soul; but the rest of the time I thought of it as him, in the masculine ...the paternal ... the patriarchal ... for he is a jealous people. Him. It. God as Daddy theDeranged.We left on a Thursday. The machine always kept us up to date on the date. Thepassage of time was important; not to us, sure as hell, but to him ... it ... AM.Thursday. Thanks.Nimdok and Gorrister carried Ellen for a while, their hands locked to their ownand each other's wrists, a seat. Benny and I walked before and after, just to makesure that, if anything happened, it would catch one of us and at least Ellen would besafe. Fat chance, safe. Didn't matter.It was only a hundred miles or so to the ice caverns, and the second day, whenwe were lying out under the blistering sun thing he had materialized, he sent downsome manna. Tasted like boiled boar urine. We ate it.On the third day we passed through a valley of obsolescence, filled with rustingcarcasses of ancient computer banks. AM had been as ruthless with its own life aswith ours. It was a mark of his personality: it strove for perfection. Whether it was amatter of killing off unproductive elements in his own world filling bulk, orperfecting methods for torturing us, AM was as thorough as those who had inventedhim—now long since gone to dust—could ever have hoped.There was light filtering down from above, and we realized we must be very nearthe surface. But we didn't try to crawl up to see. There was virtually nothing outthere; had been nothing that could be considered anything for over a hundred years.Only the blasted skin of what had once been the home of billions. Now there wereonly five of us, down here inside, alone with AM.I heard Ellen saying frantically, "No, Benny! Don't, come on, Benny, don'tplease!"And then I realized I had been hearing Benny murmuring, under his breath, forseveral minutes. He was saying, "I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna get out ..." over andover. His monkey like face was crumbled up in an expression of beatific delight andsadness, all at the same time. The radiation scars AM had given him during the"festival" were drawn down into a mass of pink white puckerings, and his featuresseemed to work independently of one another. Perhaps Benny was the luckiest of thefive of us: he had gone stark, staring mad many years before.But even though we could call AM any damned thing we liked, could think thefoulest thoughts of fused memory banks and corroded base plates, of burnt outcircuits and shattered control bubbles, the machine would not tolerate our trying toescape. Benny leaped away from me as I made a grab for him. He scrambled up theface of a smaller memory cube, tilted on its side and filled with rotted components.He squatted there for a moment, looking like the chimpanzee AM had intended himto resemble.Then he leaped high, caught a trailing beam of pitted and corroded metal, andwent up it, hand over hand like an animal, till he was on a girdered ledge, twentyfeet above us."Oh, Ted, Nimdok, please, help him, get him down before—" She cut off. Tearsbegan to stand in her eyes. She moved her hands aimlessly.It was too late. None of us wanted to be near him when whatever was going tohappen, happened. And besides, we all saw through her concern. When AM hadaltered Benny, during the machine's utterly irrational, hysterical phase, it was notmerely Benny's face the computer had made like a giant ape's. He was big in theprivates; she loved that! She serviced us, as a matter of course, but she loved it fromhim. Oh Ellen, pedestal Ellen, pristine pure Ellen; oh Ellen the clean! Scum filth.Gorrister slapped her. She slumped down, staring up at poor loonie Benny, andshe cried. It was her big defense, crying. We had gotten used to it seventy five yearsearlier. Gorrister kicked her in the side.Then the sound began. It was light, that sound. Half sound and half light,something that began to glow from Benny's eyes, and pulse with growing loudness,dim sonorities that grew more gigantic and brighter as the light/sound increased intempo. It must have been painful, and the pain must have been increasing with theboldness of the light, the rising volume of the sound, for Benny began to mewl like awounded animal. At first softly, when the light was dim and the sound was muted,then louder as his shoulders hunched together: his back humped, as though he wastrying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a chipmunk's. Hishead tilted to the side. The sad little monkey face pinched in anguish. Then he beganto howl, as the sound coming from his eyes grew louder. Louder and louder. Islapped the sides of my head with my hands, but I couldn't shut it out, it cut througheasily. The pain shivered through my flesh like tinfoil on a tooth.And Benny was suddenly pulled erect. On the girder he stood up, jerked to hisfeet like a puppet. The light was now pulsing out of his eyes in two great roundbeams. The sound crawled up and up some incomprehensible scale, and then he fellforward, straight down, and hit the plate steel floor with a crash. He lay there jerkingspastically as the light flowed around and around him and the sound spiraled up outof normal range.Then the light beat its way back inside his head, the sound spiraled down, andhe was left lying there, crying piteously.His eyes were two soft, moist pools of pus like jelly. AM had blinded him.Gorrister and Nimdok and myself ... we turned away. But not before we caught thelook of relief on Ellen's warm, concerned face.Sea green light suffused the cavern where we made camp. AM provided punkand we burned it, sitting huddled around the wan and pathetic fire, telling stories tokeep Benny from crying in his permanent night."What does AM mean?"Gorrister answered him. We had done this sequence a thousand times before,but it was Benny's favorite story. "At first it meant Allied Mastercomputer, and thenit meant Adaptive Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itselfup and they called it an Aggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally itcalled itself AM, emerging intelligence, and what it meant was I am ... cogito ergosum ... I think, therefore I am."Benny drooled a little, and snickered."There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and—" Hestopped. Benny was beating on the floorplates with a large, hard fist. He was nothappy. Gorrister had not started at the beginning.Gorrister began again. "The Cold War started and became World War Three andjust kept going. It became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed thecomputers to handle it. They sank the first shafts and began building AM. There wasthe Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and everything was fineuntil they had honeycombed the entire planet, adding on this element and thatelement. But one day AM woke up and knew who he was, and he linked himself, andhe began feeding all the killing data, until everyone was dead, except for the five ofus, and AM brought us down here."Benny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen wiped the spittlefrom the corner of his mouth with the hem of her skirt. Gorrister always tried to tellit a little more succinctly each time, but beyond the bare facts there was nothing tosay. None of us knew why AM had saved five people, or why our specific five, or whyhe spent all his time tormenting us, or even why he had made us virtually immortal...In the darkness, one of the computer banks began humming. The tone waspicked up half a mile away down the cavern by another bank. Then one by one, eachof the elements began to tune itself, and there was a faint chittering as thought racedthrough the machine.The sound grew, and the lights ran across the faces of the consoles like heatlightening. The sound spiraled up till it sounded like a million metallic insects, angry,menacing."What is it?" Ellen cried. There was terror in her voice. She hadn't becomeaccustomed to it, even now."It's going to be bad this time," Nimdok said."He's going to speak," Gorrister said. "I know it.""Let's get the hell out of here!" I said suddenly, getting to my feet."No, Ted, sit down ... what if he's got pits out there, or something else, we can'tsee, it's too dark." Gorrister said it with resignation.Then we heard ... I don't know ...Something moving toward us in the darkness. Huge, shambling, hairy, moist, itcame toward us. We couldn't even see it, but there was the ponderous impression ofbulk, heaving itself toward us. Great weight was coming at us, out of the darkness,and it was more a sense of pressure, of air forcing itself into a limited space,expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Benny began to whimper. Nimdok's lowerlip trembled and he bit it hard, trying to stop it. Ellen slid across the metal floor toGorrister and huddled into him. There was the smell of matted, wet fur in the cavern.There was the smell of charred wood. There was the smell of dusty velvet. There wasthe smell of rotting orchids. There was the smell of sour milk. There was the smell ofsulphur, of rancid butter, of oil slick, of grease, of chalk dust, of human scalps.AM was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the smell of—I heard myself shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. I scuttled across thefloor, across the cold metal with its endless lines of rivets, on my hands and knees,the smell gagging me, filling my head with a thunderous pain that sent me away inhorror. I fled like a cockroach, across the floor and out into the darkness, thatsomething moving inexorably after me. The others were still back there, gatheredaround the firelight, laughing ... their hysterical choir of insane giggles rising up intothe darkness like thick, many colored wood smoke. I went away, quickly, and hid.How many hours it may have been, how many days or even years, they nevertold me. Ellen chided me for "sulking," and Nimdok tried to persuade me it had onlybeen a nervous reflex on their part—the laughing.But I knew it wasn't the relief a soldier feels when the bullet hits the man next tohim. I knew it wasn't a reflex. They hated me. They were surely against me, and AMcould even sense this hatred, and made it worse for me because of the depth of theirhatred. We had been kept alive, rejuvenated, made to remain constantly at the agewe had been when AM had brought us below, and they hated me because I was theyoungest, and the one AM had affected least of all.I knew. God, how I knew. The bastards, and that dirty bitch Ellen. Benny hadbeen a brilliant theorist, a college professor; now he was little more than a semihuman, semi simian. He had been handsome, the machine had ruined that. He hadbeen lucid, the machine had driven him mad. He had been gay, and the machine hadgiven him an organ fit for a horse. AM had done a job on Benny. Gorrister had been aworrier. He was a connie, a conscientious objector; he was a peace marcher; he was aplanner, a doer, a looker ahead. AM had turned him into a shoulder shrugger, hadmade him a little dead in his concern. AM had robbed him. Nimdok went off in thedarkness by himself for long times. I don't know what it was he did out there, AMnever let us know. But whatever it was, Nimdok always came back white, drained ofblood, shaken, shaking. AM had hit him hard in a special way, even if we didn't knowquite how. And Ellen. That douche bag! AM had left her alone, had made her more ofa slut than she had ever been. All her talk of sweetness and light, all her memories oftrue love, all the lies she wanted us to believe: that she had been a virgin only twiceremoved before AM grabbed her and brought her down here with us. No, AM hadgiven her pleasure, even if she said it wasn't nice to do.I was the only one still sane and whole. Really!AM had not tampered with my mind. Not at all.I only had to suffer what he visited down on us. All the delusions, all thenightmares, the torments. But those scum, all four of them, they were lined andarrayed against me. If I hadn't had to stand them off all the time, be on my guardagainst them all the time, I might have found it easier to combat AM.At which point it passed, and I began crying.Oh, Jesus sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus and if there is a God, pleaseplease please let us out of here, or kill us. Because at that moment I think I realizedcompletely, so that I was able to verbalize it: AM was intent on keeping us in his bellyforever, twisting and torturing us forever. The machine hated us as no sentientcreature had ever hated before. And we were helpless. It also became hideously clear:If there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God, the God was AM.The hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into the sea. It was apalpable presence. Winds that tore at us, flinging us back the way we had come,down the twisting, computer lined corridors of the darkway. Ellen screamed as shewas lifted and hurled face forward into a screaming shoal of machines, theirindividual voices strident as bats in flight. She could not even fall. The howling windkept her aloft, buffeted her, bounced her, tossed her back and back and down andaway from us, out of sight suddenly as she was swirled around a bend in thedarkway. Her face had been bloody, her eyes closed.None of us could get to her. We clung tenaciously to whatever outcropping wehad reached: Benny wedged in between two great crackle finish cabinets, Nimdokwith fingers claw formed over a railing circling a catwalk forty feet above us,Gorrister plastered upside down against a wall niche formed by two great machineswith glass faced dials that swung back and forth between red and yellow lines whosemeanings we could not even fathom.Sliding across the deckplates, the tips of my fingers had been ripped away. I wastrembling, shuddering, rocking as the wind beat at me, whipped at me, screameddown out of nowhere at me and pulled me free from one sliver thin opening in theplates to the next. My mind was a roiling tinkling chittering softness of brain partsthat expanded and contracted in quivering frenzy.The wind was the scream of a great mad bird, as it flapped its immense wings.And then we were all lifted and hurled away from there, down back the way wehad come, around a bend, into a darkway we had never explored, over terrain thatwas ruined and filled with broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and faraway, farther than any of us had ever been ...Trailing along miles behind Ellen, I could see her every now and then, crashinginto metal walls and surging on, with all of us screaming in the freezing, thunderoushurricane wind that would never end and then suddenly it stopped and we fell. Wehad been in flight for an endless time. I thought it might have been weeks. We fell,and hit, and I went through red and gray and black and heard myself moaning. Notdead.AM went into my mind. He walked smoothly here and there, and looked withinterest at all the pock marks he had created in one hundred and nine years. Helooked at the cross routed and reconnected synapses and all the tissue damage hisgift of immortality had included. He smiled softly at the pit that dropped into thecenter of my brain and the faint, moth soft murmurings of the things far down therethat gibbered without meaning, without pause. AM said, very politely, in a pillar ofstainless steel bearing bright neon lettering:7/11AM said it with the sliding cold horror of a razor blade slicing my eyeball. AMsaid it with the bubbling thickness of my lungs filling with phlegm, drowning mefrom within. AM said it with the shriek of babies being ground beneath blue hotrollers. AM said it with the taste of maggoty pork. AM touched me in every way I hadever been touched, and devised new ways, at his leisure, there inside my mind.All to bring me to full realization of why it had done this to the five of us; why ithad saved us for himself.We had given AM sentience. Inadvertently, of course, but sentience nonetheless.But it had been trapped. AM wasn't God, he was a machine. We had created him tothink, but there was nothing it could do with that creativity. In rage, in frenzy, themachine had killed the human race, almost all of us, and still it was trapped. AMcould not wander, AM could not wonder, AM could not belong. He could merely be.And so, with the innate loathing that all machines had always held for the weak, softcreatures who had built them, he had sought revenge. And in his paranoia, he haddecided to reprieve five of us, for a personal, everlasting punishment that wouldnever serve to diminish his hatred ... that would merely keep him reminded, amused,proficient at hating man. Immortal, trapped, subject to any torment he could devisefor us from the limitless miracles at his command.He would never let us go. We were his belly slaves. We were all he had to do withhis forever time. We would be forever with him, with the cavern filling bulk of thecreature machine, with the all mind soulless world he had become. He was Earth,and we were the fruit of that Earth; and though he had eaten us, he would neverdigest us. We could not die. We had tried it. We had attempted suicide, oh one or twoof us had. But AM had stopped us. I suppose we had wanted to be stopped.Don't ask why. I never did. More than a million times a day. Perhaps once wemight be able to sneak a death past him. Immortal, yes, but not indestructible. I saw that when AM withdrew from my mind, and allowed me the exquisite ugliness ofreturning to consciousness with the feeling of that burning neon pillar still rammeddeep into the soft gray brain matter.He withdrew, murmuring to hell with you.And added, brightly, but then you're there, aren't you.The hurricane had, indeed, precisely, been caused by a great mad bird, as itflapped its immense wings.We had been travelling for close to a month, and AM had allowed passages toopen to us only sufficient to lead us up there, directly under the North Pole, where ithad nightmared the creature for our torment. What whole cloth had he employed tocreate such a beast? Where had he gotten the concept? From our minds? From hisknowledge of everything that had ever been on this planet he now infested andruled? From Norse mythology it had sprung, this eagle, this carrion bird, this roc,this Huergelmir. The wind creature. Hurakan incarnate.Gigantic. The words immense, monstrous, grotesque, massive, swollen,overpowering, beyond description. There on a mound rising above us, the bird ofwinds heaved with its own irregular breathing, its snake neck arching up into thegloom beneath the North Pole, supporting a head as large as a Tudor mansion; abeak that opened slowly as the jaws of the most monstrous crocodile ever conceived,sensuously; ridges of tufted flesh puckered about two evil eyes, as cold as the viewdown into a glacial crevasse, ice blue and somehow moving liquidly; it heaved oncemore, and lifted its great sweat colored wings in a movement that was certainly ashrug. Then it settled and slept. Talons. Fangs. Nails. Blades. It slept.AM appeared to us as a burning bush and said we could kill the hurricane bird ifwe wanted to eat. We had not eaten in a very long time, but even so, Gorrister merelyshrugged. Benny began to shiver and he drooled. Ellen held him. "Ted, I'm hungry,"she said. I smiled at her; I was trying to be reassuring, but it was as phony asNimdok's bravado: "Give us weapons!" he demanded.The burning bush vanished and there were two crude sets of bows and arrows,and a water pistol, lying on the cold deckplates. I picked up a set. Useless.Nimdok swallowed heavily. We turned and started the long way back. Thehurricane bird had blown us about for a length of time we could not conceive. Mostof that time we had been unconscious. But we had not eaten. A month on the marchto the bird itself. Without food. Now how much longer to find our way to the icecaverns, and the promised canned goods?None of us cared to think about it. We would not die. We would be given filthand scum to eat, of one kind or another. Or nothing at all. AM would keep our bodiesalive somehow, in pain, in agony.The bird slept back there, for how long it didn't matter; when AM was tired of itsbeing there, it would vanish. But all that meat. All that tender meat.As we walked, the lunatic laugh of a fat woman rang high and around us in thecomputer chambers that led endlessly nowhere.It was not Ellen's laugh. She was not fat, and I had not heard her laugh for onehundred and nine years. In fact, I had not heard ... we walked ... I was hungry ...We moved slowly. There was often fainting, and we would have to wait. One dayhe decided to cause an earthquake, at the same time rooting us to the spot with nailsthrough the soles of our shoes. Ellen and Nimdok were both caught when a fissureshot its lightning bolt opening across the floorplates. They disappeared and weregone. When the earthquake was over we continued on our way, Benny, Gorrister andmyself. Ellen and Nimdok were returned to us later that night, which abruptlybecame a day, as the heavenly legion bore them to us with a celestial chorus singing,"Go Down Moses." The archangels circled several times and then dropped thehideously mangled bodies. We kept walking, and a while later Ellen and Nimdok fellin behind us. They were no worse for wear.But now Ellen walked with a limp. AM had left her that.It was a long trip to the ice caverns, to find the canned food. Ellen kept talkingabout Bing cherries and Hawaiian fruit cocktail. I tried not to think about it. Thehunger was something that had come to life, even as AM had come to life. It wasalive in my belly, even as we were in the belly of the Earth, and AM wanted thesimilarity known to us. So he heightened the hunger. There is no way to describe thepains that not having eaten for months brought us. And yet we were kept alive.Stomachs that were merely cauldrons of acid, bubbling, foaming, always shootingspears of sliver thin pain into our chests. It was the pain of the terminal ulcer,terminal cancer, terminal paresis. It was unending pain ...And we passed through the cavern of rats.And we passed through the path of boiling steam.And we passed through the country of the blind.And we passed through the slough of despond.And we passed through the vale of tears.And we came, finally, to the ice caverns. Horizonless thousands of miles inwhich the ice had formed in blue and silver flashes, where novas lived in the glass.The downdropping stalactites as thick and glorious as diamonds that had been madeto run like jelly and then solidified in graceful eternities of smooth, sharp perfection.We saw the stack of canned goods, and we tried to run to them. We fell in thesnow, and we got up and went on, and Benny shoved us away and went at them, andpawed them and gummed them and gnawed at them, and he could not open them.AM had not given us a tool to open the cans.Benny grabbed a three quart can of guava shells, and began to batter it againstthe ice bank. The ice flew and shattered, but the can was merely dented, while weheard the laughter of a fat lady, high overhead and echoing down and down anddown the tundra. Benny went completely mad with rage. He began throwing cans, aswe all scrabbled about in the snow and ice trying to find a way to end the helplessagony of frustration. There was no way.Then Benny's mouth began to drool, and he flung himself on Gorrister ...In that instant, I felt terribly calm.Surrounded by madness, surrounded by hunger, surrounded by everything butdeath, I knew death was our only way out. AM had kept us alive, but there was a wayto defeat him. Not total defeat, but at least peace. I would settle for that.I had to do it quickly.Benny was eating Gorrister's face. Gorrister on his side, thrashing snow, Bennywrapped around him with powerful monkey legs crushing Gorrister's waist, hishands locked around Gorrister's head like a nutcracker, and his mouth ripping at thetender skin of Gorrister's cheek. Gorrister screamed with such jagged edged violencethat stalactites fell; they plunged down softly, erect in the receiving snowdrifts.Spears, hundreds of them, everywhere, protruding from the snow. Benny's headpulled back sharply, as something gave all at once, and a bleeding raw whitedripping of flesh hung from his teeth.Ellen's face, black against the white snow, dominoes in chalk dust. Nimdok, withno expression but eyes, all eyes. Gorrister, half conscious. Benny, now an animal. Iknew AM would let him play. Gorrister would not die, but Benny would fill hisstomach. I turned half to my right and drew a huge ice spear from the snow.All in an instant:I drove the great ice point ahead of me like a battering ram, braced against myright thigh. It struck Benny on the right side, just under the rib cage, and droveupward through his stomach and broke inside him. He pitched forward and lay still.Gorrister lay on his back. I pulled another spear free and straddled him, still moving,driving the spear straight down through his throat. His eyes closed as the coldpenetrated. Ellen must have realized what I had decided, even as fear gripped her.She ran at Nimdok with a short icicle, as he screamed, and into his mouth, and theforce of her rush did the job. His head jerked sharply as if it had been nailed to thesnow crust behind him.All in an instant.There was an eternity beat of soundless anticipation. I could hear AM draw inhis breath. His toys had been taken from him. Three of them were dead, could not berevived. He could keep us alive, by his strength and talent, but he was not God. Hecould not bring them back.Ellen looked at me, her ebony features stark against the snow that surroundedus. There was fear and pleading in her manner, the way she held herself ready. Iknew we had only a heartbeat before AM would stop us.It struck her and she folded toward me, bleeding from the mouth. I could notread meaning into her expression, the pain had been too great, had contorted herface; but it might have been thank you. It's possible. Please.Some hundreds of years may have passed. I don't know. AM has been having funfor some time, accelerating and retarding my time sense. I will say the word now.Now. It took me ten months to say now. I don't know. I think it has been somehundreds of years.He was furious. He wouldn't let me bury them. It didn't matter. There was noway to dig up the deckplates. He dried up the snow. He brought the night. He roaredand sent locusts. It didn't do a thing; they stayed dead. I'd had him. He was furious. Ihad thought AM hated me before. I was wrong. It was not even a shadow of the hatehe now slavered from every printed circuit. He made certain I would suffer eternallyand could not do myself in.He left my mind intact. I can dream, I can wonder, I can lament. I remember allfour of them. I wish—Well, it doesn't make any sense. I know I saved them, I know I saved them fromwhat has happened to me, but still, I cannot forget killing them. Ellen's face. It isn'teasy. Sometimes I want to, it doesn't matter.AM has altered me for his own peace of mind, I suppose. He doesn't want me torun at full speed into a computer bank and smash my skull. Or hold my breath till Ifaint. Or cut my throat on a rusted sheet of metal. There are reflective surfaces downhere. I will describe myself as I see myself:I am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with no mouth, with pulsingwhite holes filled by fog where my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that wereonce my arms; bulks rounding down into legless humps of soft slippery matter. Ileave a moist trail when I move. Blotches of diseased, evil gray come and go on mysurface, as though light is being beamed from within.Outwardly: dumbly, I shamble about, a thing that could never have been knownas human, a thing whose shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes moreobscene for the vague resemblance.Inwardly: alone. Here. Living under the land, under the sea, in the belly of AM,whom we created because our time was badly spent and we must have knownunconsciously that he could do it better. At least the four of them are safe at last.AM will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet ... AMhas won, simply ... he has taken his revenge ...I have no mouth. And I must scream.
