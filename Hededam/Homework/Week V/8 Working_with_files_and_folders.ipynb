    "If the data that you need to work with in a reseaech project is saved as a file on your computer, you can write a program to read this file and to make its contents available within the context of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, files can be read using the `open()` function. The result of this function is a new object which is called a file handler (or, more specifically, a `TextIOWrapper` object). Simply put, a file handler is an object which establishes a connection to the text file on your disk. You are free to give this file handler object any name you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the `open()` function, you are also recommended to specify the character encoding scheme that has been used in the text file, using the `encoding` parameter. This will help Python to process all the characters correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established via the `open()` fuction, you can access the contents of the file in a variety of ways. A first option is to read the contents on a line-by-line or a paragraph-by-paragraph basis. This first approach can be followed when units such as lines or paragraphs in the text are delineated using the hard return or the newline character. If this is the case, the file handler that is created for the file, using `open()`, also becomes iterable: the `for` keyword can then be used to iterate across the various units represented by this file handler. \n",
    " \n",
    "The code below demonstrates how you can read and display the full contents of a text file, paragraph by paragraph. It assumes that there is a file named \"BraveNewWorld.txt\", saved in the same directory as the code. It also assumes that the various paragraphs are separated using a hard return. "

      "The enormous room on the ground-floor faced towards the north. Cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. Wintriness responded to wintriness. The overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. The light was frozen, dead, a ghost. Only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work-tables.\n",
      "'And this,' said the Director opening the door, 'is the Fertilizing Room.'\n",
      "Bent over their instruments, three hundred Fertilizers were plunged, as the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. A troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the Director's heels. Each of them carried a note-book, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. Straight from the horse's mouth. It was a rare privilege. The D.H.C. for Central London always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments.\n",
      "'Just to give you a general idea,' he would explain to them. For of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently--though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. For particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectually necessary evils. Not philosophers, but fret-sawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.\n",
      "'To-morrow,' he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, 'you'll be settling down to serious work. You won't have time for generalities. Meanwhile...'\n",

The `join()` function always follows the conventions that are in place on a given operating system for representing paths. There can often be certain differences.
